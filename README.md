Forays into working with float. 

Took some time to understand how float works. Wouldn't say that I'm 100% there yet, but I have a better understanding thanks to some fun mishaps along the way. 

I was struggling to get the text to move to the right of the image, still not clear on why, but that meant I needed to go digging for a solution. Eventually I found the *span* tag to help me out. At first though, as I was trying to get that pesky text to move to the right, I pulled the everything in the *p* tag out of the *section* tag and that did not work at all. Since, according to the code, I had essentially just added a new element for everything to 'float' around, I just ended up with some strange cascading mess. 

As you can see everything is back in place now though and I had the opportunity to work with *span* and *float*, so all around an illuminating activity.
